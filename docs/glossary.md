**Humidity**: the humidity at the start of the game

**Wind Speed**: the wind speed at the start of the game

**Surface**: 11 Possible Choices: Grass; AstroTurf; AstroPlay; FieldTurf; SportGrass; NeXTurf; MomentumTurf; DD GrassMaster; Sportex; A Turf Titan; UBU Speed Series S5M

**Over/Under**: the o/u at the start of the game

**Point Spread**: the point spread at the start of the game

**Quarter**: the quarter the play is in

**Down**: the down of the play

**Yards to go**: the distance to go for a first down

**Line of scrimmage**: the line of scrimmage for the play, in other words, the location on the field

**Shutgun**: if play is in shotgun formation

**No Huddle**: if there is or isnt a huddle before the play

**Number of players in the backfield**: RB + TE + FB + WR

**Extra Men on the Line**: Number of players lined up on either side of the Offensive Tackles - usually a Tight End.

**Bunched/Stacked Formations (BSF)**: Can be 'B', 'S1', 'S2' or 'BS'. Bunched formations involve 3 receivers within a box not taller than 3 yards and spaced less than 2 standard arm lengths away from their neighbour.

Stacked Formations are where 2 receivers are in-line vertically with at least 1.5 yards distance between them. S1 is one pair while S2 denotes 2 pairs. When both bunched/stacked are present we mark (BS).

**Hash Mark Location**: Where the ball is placed when the center has it in his hand. Values can be (L)eft hash, (R)ight hash or in-between (M for Middle).

**Motion**: There are 2 types of motion: Pre-snap (P) which starts and stops before the snap and the more aggressive type of motion that is occurring during the snap (S). When both occur we mark 'PS'.

**Number of Defensive Linemen on the field**

**Number of Linebackers on the field**

**Number of Defenders in the box**

**Number of DB's in the box**

**Play Action Pass**: Does not consider whether a defense was fooled or not, just that a QB motioned to the RB with the ball and some effort to sell the run occurred.

**Option Play**: Values can be RPO (run/pass), RUN (run/qbrun) or blank when there is not an option.

**Trick Look**: Usually it's a wildcat formation or when the QB lines up in a uncommon position. Fake punts and fake field goals are not trick looks since they look like regular punts or FG's

**Trick Play**: Fake punts, double passes, flea flickers, wildcats etc

**QB Pressure**: Plays where the pocket is breached and the QB is near the breach.

**QB Hit**: Quarterback was brought to the ground or otherwise significantly man-handled.

**QB Hurry**: The Defense forces the QB to leave the pocket or forces the QB to throw the ball before he's fully ready.

**Hindered Throwing Motion**: QB's throwing motion was hindered in some way by a defender.

**Pass Rush**: Total number of players rushing the passer.

**Blitz**: Total number of LB's and DB's blitzing.

**DB Blitz**: Number of DB's blitzing. This is included in the Blitz total.

**Stun Pass Rushers**: These are the number blitzing LB's who replace a DL dropping back into coverage. Included in the PRU total

**Out of Pocket Pass (OOP)**: Quarterback attempts the pass out of the pocket whether pressured or not. See 'OOPD' for more details.

**Out Of Pocket Pass Details (OOPD)**: This field helps to expand on why an OOP occurred. When OOP is '1', this field will have a value of 'DE' (by Design); 'DR' (Designed Rollout); 'P' (due to Pressure) or 'C' (QB decided on his own to leave a Clean pocket).

**Play Clock Running**: whether or not play clock was running

**Play Clock Time**: Seconds left on the play clock when the ball was snapped.

**# of Running Backs on the field**

**# of Tight Ends on the field**

**Quarterback Position**: QB (under center), QB-5, QB-6 etc

## Available But Unused Statistics

**QB Run (QBRU)**: A designed running play for the QB. These are only marked on runs by a natural QB where he lined up as a QB. Also, sneaks and kneel-downs are not counted

**QB Sneak (SNEAK)**: Quarterback dives ahead directly off the snap for short-yardage. A high percentage conversion but these plays also open up QB's for some physical abuse

**QB Scramble (SCRM)**: Play design is initially a pass but QB elects to run based on pressure; a lack of open receivers, or, simply seeing an opportunity to make positive yardage running himself

**Available Targets (AVT)**: Number of skill players (WR-TE-RB) running a route on the play. AVT does not determine whether the target was open or not.

**Depth Of Target Rank (DOTR)**: The rank of pass targets according to distance in yards from the QB. #1 is closest to the QB. Targets are ranked at the point the ball is closest to the receiver.

**Coverage on Target (COV)**: Uncovered is 0, single coverage is 1, double is 2.

**Play Timestamp HR (STAMP_HR)**: Hours from start of game at point of snap.

**Play Timestamp MIN (STAMP_MIN)**: Minutes from start of last hour at point of snap.

**Play Timestamp SEC (STAMP_SEC)**: Seconds from start of last minute at point of snap.

**Shovel/Touch Pass (SHOV)**: 0 or 1 if a touch/shovel pass

**Screen Pass (SCRE)**: 0 or 1 if a screen pass

**Number of Screening Players (NSCRE)**: Used in combination with 'SCRE', this field shows the actual number of players who were screening
