| pfr_weighted_career_approximate_value              | Weighted Career Approximate Value                | Pro Football Reference Career Approximate Value (weighted) - a metric that attempts to put a single numerical value on a player's career. The weighted career AV is computed by summing 100% of the player's best-season AV, 95% of his second-best-season AV, 90% of his third best, and so on. The idea is that the weighted career AV rating should weight peak seasons slightly more than "compiler"-type seasons.
