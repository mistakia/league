> THE COMMISSIONER

**Establishment of Office.**

1. The Office of the Commissioner of the LEAGUE is hereby established.

**Powers and Duties.**

2. The functions of the Commissioner shall include:

(a) To serve as the Chief Administrative, Dispute Resolution and Financial officer of the LEAGUE.

(b) To investigate, either upon complaint or upon the Commissioner’s own initiative, any act, transaction or practice charged, alleged or suspected not to be in the best interests of the game of fantasy football, with authority to compel the Teams and Managers therein to respond to such requests as may be necessary to resolve the same, and upon consideration or upon a refusal or failure to comply with such requests, to impose such penalties as are hereinafter provided.

(c\) To determine, after investigation, what preventative, remedial or punitive action is appropriate in the circumstances of the same act, transaction or practice, and to take such action against Teams, Managers or other individuals, as the case may be.

(d) To appoint such persons to assist in the execution of the duties of the Commissioner as may be necessary in the Commissioner’s exclusive discretion.

(e) To review and approve player extensions & designations and transactions between Teams in respect of competitive balance, freedom from collusion or other restricted practices, and for the best interests of fantasy football.

(f) To make decisions, or to appoint persons to make decisions, in respect of rule interpretations, administrative functions, financial transactions or disciplinary action, as may be necessary.

(g) To record all amendments to this Constitution in Appendix B “Amendment History”.

**Prescribed Penalties.**

3. In the case of conduct deemed by the Commissioner not to be in the best interests of the LEAGUE or fantasy football, punitive or disciplinary actions against Teams or Managers may include any one or more of the following:

(a) A formal warning;

(b) A reprimand;

(c\) A reversal, amendment to, or denial of a challenged transaction;

(d) A forfeit of a specified draft pick;

(e) A reduction in waiver claim priority;

(f) A reduction in FAAB;

(g) Suspension or removal of a Team or a Manager from the LEAGUE;

(h) Forfeit of annual dues; or

(i) Such other actions as the Commissioner may deem appropriate.

4. Decisions of the Commissioner that include penalties to Teams must be posted formally on the Boards.

**Commissioner not to Supersede Authority of Teams.**

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2, above, the Commissioner shall take no action in the best interests of fantasy football, and shall make no amendment to this Constitution or adjustment to the _status quo_ in respect of any matter that requires the Teams to take a vote, as set forth in Article IV, Section 2.

**Procedure to Review and/or Vacate Commissioner’s Decision.**

6. Any action of the Commissioner taken pursuant to this Article, regardless of whether or not it is specifically designated as “reviewable”, may be overturned under the following process:

(a) Teams interested in the outcome of the Commissioner’s decision (i.e., the Team that would receive the direct benefit of an overturned vote and any other Team(s) directly involved in the challenged transaction and/or act) are deemed Interested Parties and are not eligible to participate in a vote to overturn that decision.

_i. For further clarity, each Team’s interest in the general competitiveness of each other Team shall not constitute an “interest” in the outcome of a decision for the purposes of subsection (a)._

(b) One-third of Teams eligible to cast a vote to overturn must agree to a petition for reconsideration or a vote upon the challenged decision. That petition must be made within one week of the formal posting of the challenged decision on the Boards.

_i. For further clarity, without such a petition being made, there shall be no review of a Commissioner’s decision._

(c\) If the Commissioner does not reconsider the decision, a vote shall be held.

(d) The Commissioner and all Interested Parties may make such representations to the Teams as they may wish in support of their preferred outcome.

(e) The decision of the Commissioner may be overturned only upon a two-thirds majority vote of eligible Teams.

(f) If such a majority is not achieved, the decision of the Commissioner stands.

(g) If such a majority is achieved, the decision of the Commissioner is vacated.

_i. For further clarity, this shall not preclude further action by the Commissioner upon the same challenged act._

**Interpretive note:** _For example, the Commissioner may decide pursuant to Article III, Section (3), Subsection (g) that Team X is suspended permanently from the LEAGUE due to abusive behaviour against the best interests of fantasy football. That decision is posted on the Boards at 5:35 PM EST on a Tuesday. One-third of Teams (which do not include the abusive Team, because it is an Interested Party) petition the Commissioner for reconsideration or a re-vote, pursuant to Article III, Section 6, Subsection (b), and do so before the deadline at 5:35 PM EST the following Tuesday._

_The Commissioner refuses to reconsider, and a vote is therefore held. More than two-thirds of Teams vote that the decision should be vacated. There is therefore, at this point, no longer any decision of the Commissioner in respect of the challenged abusive acts. The Commissioner then decides pursuant to Article III, Section (3), Subsection (e) that the abusive Team shall forfeit a rookie draft pick instead. Only two Teams petition for a reconsideration of that decision. Because that is an insufficient number to form a petition, that decision stands and the abusive Team forfeits a rookie draft pick in the following Offseason._

**Term Limits and Elections.**

7. The Commissioner shall hold office for a minimum term of two (2) years or for such longer term as shall be voted by the Teams in a given offseason.

8. The Commissioner shall not be subject to a term limit and may succeed himself indefinitely.

9. With the exception of an election pursuant to Section 11, no election of a Commissioner shall take place less than sixty (60) days prior to the LEAGUE draft.

10. The election of a Commissioner shall be by simple majority, and each Team shall have one (1) vote. In the event of a tie, another election shall take place at least once per week until a Commissioner is elected.

**Incapacity.**

11. In the event that the Commissioner is unable or unwilling to continue in his role, a vote shall be held immediately to replace him from among the ranks of the Team managers following the above process. In the event that the Commissioner disagrees that he is unable to continue, that decision shall be reviewable pursuant to Section 6.

**Impartiality.**

12. The Commissioner vows to remain impartial and unbiased when making decisions involving the League and its Players.

**Impeachment.**

13. A two-thirds majority vote of Teams is needed to Impeach the Commissioner.

14. The Commissioner shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for Bribery, Maladministration or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

(a) improperly exceeding or abusing the powers of the office;

(b) behavior incompatible with the function and purpose of the office; and

## Article XIX

> OFFENCES

**Nature of Offences.**

1. This Article deals with activities that are deemed to go beyond the scope of irregularities or minor contraventions of the Constitution and constitute wrongful conduct worthy of more severe sanctions.

**Commencement of Offence Proceedings.**

2. The Commissioner, on his own initiative or following the receipt of a complaint, whether anonymous or public, may, after satisfying himself that the complaint has merit, announce that a Team or its Manager has committed an offence, and the penalty for that offence.

3. The Commissioner is authorized to investigate alleged offences if he deems it necessary to do so, and Managers are required to assist in such investigations by providing truthful statements to the Commissioner if requested to do so.

**Offences.**

4. Everyone commits an offence who:

(a) Bribery: Provides another party with value other than in-game value in exchange for in-game value.

(b) Collusion: Agrees with another party to limit open competition in the game by deceiving, misleading or defrauding others in order for a party, who may or may not be a party to the collusion, to obtain an unfair market advantage.

i. Collusion shall be assumed in any case where one Manager acts for more than one Team at the same time.

ii. Sharing of limited resources, including but not limited to active roster space, salary space, or players.

(c\) Non-Competitive Behaviour: Demonstrates an intention not to compete that goes beyond mere negligence.

i. Under extreme circumstances, a recurring refusal to engage in reasonable transactions may be considered non-competitive behaviour.

(d) General Anti-Avoidance Provision (GAAP): Engages in conduct not otherwise prohibited by this Constitution but is generally acknowledged to be shitty.

**Penalties.**

5. Any Manager found guilty of an offence is susceptible to the most extreme penalties provided for in Article III, Section 3, including permanent suspension without refund.

6. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, punish a Team for the actions of a Manager.

7. Decisions concerning an offence and its penalty are reviewable pursuant to Article III Section 6.

**Arbitrators and Juries.**

8. The Commissioner is specifically empowered under Article III, Section 2(d) to appoint a neutral arbitrator or a jury if he, in his exclusive discretion, deems it necessary; and must do so if he is an Interested Party in an alleged offence. Despite Article III, Section 6, the decision to appoint an arbitrator or jury is not reviewable.

9. A jury vote is not binding but is advisory only.

10. Jury votes may not be secret.

11. There is no minimum quorum or representation requirement for a non-binding jury vote.

Interpretive Note: _While the Commissioner is the dispute resolution officer of the LEAGUE, in extremely rare cases the Commissioner may decide to appoint others to resolve disputes. This will be particularly – and perhaps exclusively – useful where the Commissioner is charged with, or the victim of, an offence; or where the nature of the offence is subjective. For example, the Commissioner may appoint a neutral third party arbitrator to determine what penalty, if any, a Manager should suffer for harassing him; or may appoint a small jury to determine whether or not someone’s ‘non-competitive behavior’ is enough to count as such. Jury votes are not permitted to be secret, so that the Commissioner cannot be accused of lying about their results. Neither are jury votes binding, as the Commissioner may reasonably determine that there was enough concern demonstrated in a vote to give rise to an offence, or may determine that it is unnecessary or undesirable for every Manager to weigh in. (For example, if 40% of jurors agreed that a Manager’s contact with another Manager was unreasonable harassment, the Commissioner might decide to penalize that Manager with a lighter punishment, rather than finding there was no offence at all.)_

## Article XX

> CANCELLED OR RESCHEDULED NFL GAMES

**Rescheduled.**

1. If an NFL game is cancelled or suspended, stats from the rescheduled game will be used for scoring unless the result of that NFL game is not needed to determine the NFL playoff seed of both NFL teams.
   Cancelled.

**Cancelled**

2. If a rescheduled game can not be used, the first game outside of the REGULAR SEASON will be used where the player is active and is an NFL post-season game or NFL regular-season game within the same year and where at the start of the game the result of that game is needed to determine the playoff seed of both NFL teams.

3. If a player has no such games available then stats can be used from an NFL regular-season game where at the start of the game the result of that game is needed to determine the playoff seed of the NFL opponent of that player’s NFL team.

4. If a substitute and rescheduled game is not available, the REGULAR SEASON ALL-PLAY record will be used to determine the results among teams whose results are impacted by a cancelled or suspended NFL game. REGULAR SEASON POINTS FOR would serve as a tiebreaker.
